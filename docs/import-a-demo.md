Click on any demo that you want to import and all pages, posts, galleries, portfolios, widgets and theme options will be added to your website.

## WordPress Reset

In some cases you would like to try another demo while the contents of a demo is already imported to your website. You can remove all posts, pages, etc using [WordPress Reset](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-reset/) plugin. Be aware that this plugin resets the WordPress database back to it's defaults. Deletes all customizations and content. Does not modify files only resets the database.

## When it does not work

The demo importer tries to download some files and transfer some images form our servers. That process needs some commonly available server settings. Some servers are more restricted and won't allow long execution of scripts and the demo importer won't work. In that case you have no way to use this! Instead, you can run a local server using WAMPP or MAMPP on you own computer and import the demos on your local machine to see how pages are built.
