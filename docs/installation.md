# Installation

In this section we are going to cover installing theme and plugins using different possible ways including WordPress admin panel and FTP.

First things first, to install Eram theme you need a WordPress website up and running either on your local machine or your online host. If you need help for that please check [Installing WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress) article.

Then you need to install 1. Theme itself 2. Required Plugins

# Theme

Extract the zipped package downloaded from ThemeForest to your desktop and find **hilbert.zip** file. You can install the theme using admin panel or FTP.

## Installing the theme using WordPress admin panel

Please go to WordPress _admin panel -&gt; appearance -&gt; themes_ and then _Add new -&gt; upload theme_ and upload the theme zip file. After installation, you must activate the theme as well.

## Installing theme using FTP

For any reason if you failed to upload theme with WordPress admin panel, you can also do it using FTP. Unzip the theme zip file and upload “hilbert” folder to _WordPress root -&gt; wp-content -&gt; themes_ then go to admin _panel -&gt; appearance -&gt; themes_ and activate the Eram theme.

When you activate the theme you will be redirected to a welcome screen. There you can install required plugins.

# Plugins

Upon theme activation you will see a welcome screen that will help you with the rest of the process.

## What is Hilbert Theme Plugin?

In WordPress terms, a theme is a theme and is responsible for styling and layouts. Taking that into account, we have moved all the functionalities to a single plugin that should be installed along with the theme. Theme will work without it but it is highly recommended to install it to get these cool features:

* Publications
* People
* Events
* Vacancies
* Some other stuff

## What about other recommended plugins?

### Contact Form 7.

This is a popular plugin to make contact forms and Eram theme supports this plugin and we have used this plugin in our demos, so if you want to import a demo you need to install this plugin as well.

### Visusal Composer.

Visual Composer is a premium plugin which is included in you package for free. It is used to help you build pages with ease. It is not necessary to install it but highly recommended if you want to import a pre made demo.

### Regenerate Thumbnails.

When you upload an image into WordPress, it makes some thumbnails with different sizes that a theme needs so if you have already images in your library, then you need to install this plugin and regenerate thumbnails.

### One Click Demo Import

This plugin is used to let you import a pre made Eram demo. Install it if you want to import a demo.
