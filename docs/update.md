# Updating Theme



## Updating theme and plugins from WordPress admin panel


The latest version of theme and plugins are always available in your account download page. You need to re-download the package and unzip it somewhere on your computer.

After unzipping the package you can find the latest version of theme but before updating you must deactivate and delete the old verison of theme.

In order to do that please go to your _admin panel -> appearance-> Themes_ and activate any other available theme other than Hilbert (Twenty Fourteen for example) and then click on Hilbert theme details.

As you can see in following figure, there is a delete link at the right bottom corner of pop up:

![update](img/up1.png)

!> Don't worry! you won't loose any data. 

OK! now we need to install the latest version.

### Updating plugins:
We have some plugins in the theme, that might need updating as well. After installing the new version of theme you will a notification in admin panel about the plugins which needs updating.

If updating fails for some reason, you can always disable and delete the plugin and then install it again.

## Updating theme using FTP
This one is little advanced, if you do have access to your server FTP you can overwrite the theme and plugins files directly.

For uploading theme, unzip the theme file and upload the **hilbert folder** to following address on your server:

> WordPress root-> wp-content-> themes

## Do I need to worry about my website contents?
Generally No, update does not effects contents unless we mention it in update section of documentation but it is recommend that you get a backup before starting the procedure.
